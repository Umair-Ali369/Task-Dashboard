## 📊 Project Summary (Dashboard with Graph-Based Insights)

The **Tasks Dashboard** is designed to visually represent task data using **dashboard-style analytics**, making it easy to understand task progress at a glance.

Instead of only listing tasks, the application summarizes task information using **graph-based insights**, similar to real productivity and admin dashboards.

## 📈 Data Visualization Overview

The dashboard conceptually uses **three types of graphs** to represent task data:

---

### 🥧 Pie Chart – Task Status Distribution

The **Pie Chart** represents the overall distribution of tasks based on their current status:

- Completed Tasks
- Pending Tasks
- In Progress Tasks

**Purpose:**
- Gives a quick overview of how tasks are distributed
- Helps users instantly understand workload completion
- Useful for performance and productivity tracking

**Logic Behind It:**
- Total tasks are divided by status
- Each slice represents a task category percentage

---

### 📊 Bar Chart – Task Count Comparison

The **Bar Chart** compares the number of tasks across different statuses:

- Completed
- Pending
- In Progress

**Purpose:**
- Makes it easy to compare task counts visually
- Highlights which task category has the highest workload
- Useful for planning and prioritization

**Logic Behind It:**
- Each bar represents a task status
- Height of bar corresponds to number of tasks

---

### 📉 Line Chart – Task Progress Over Time

The **Line Chart** represents task progress trends over time:

- Tasks added
- Tasks completed
- Tasks updated

**Purpose:**
- Shows productivity trends
- Helps understand progress patterns
- Useful for long-term task tracking

**Logic Behind It:**
- X-axis represents time
- Y-axis represents task count
- Line changes based on task activity

---

## 🧠 Dashboard Insight Value

By combining **task lists** with **graph-based summaries**, the dashboard provides:

- Clear task visibility
- Faster decision-making
- Better productivity monitoring
- Real-world admin dashboard experience

This approach mirrors professional project management tools where **data is not only stored but also visualized** for better understanding.
